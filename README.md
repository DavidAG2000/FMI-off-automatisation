First of all - the script ONLY runs with API Keys for 2captcha and sickw. YOU NEED BALANCE ON THE SITES.
You need to add your own keys to the .env file
The script will utilize both APIs one time while processing 1 IMEI.
1 IMEI will cost you around 0.071 USD in total so around 7 cents.
it will take around 24 - 48h to unlock your device. The success rate is about 80% but highly depends on how old your device is the older the better

On 2captcha you can top up 3 dollars and you can process around 600 captchas.
On sickw you need to recharge around 5-50 dollars depending on how many devices you want to process.

1. Register on 2captcha and sickw - top up your balance and get your API Keys.
